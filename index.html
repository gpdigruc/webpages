        <p>The Earth is the third planet from the sun. It's atmosphere is made up of mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen. It houses bodies of water and living organisims which sets this planet apart from the rest!</p>

        <p>To get something into orbit for example, a rocket, Newton's thought process involved a key factor: speed. The stronger the rocket's initial boost is, the faster the object travels, allowing it to reach a state where it moves around Earth instead of fall back down to land. This speed is known as orbital velocity and was discovered by Newton.</p>
